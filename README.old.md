# [Photos From Here](https://nicodalfonso.gitlab.io/photos-from-here )

## Overview
This is a project that is designed to explore the connections between various public APIs. By combining the Geolocation API, Flickr API, and Google Places API, visitors to this site should be able to browse through random photos that were taken near a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. The photos are sourced from Flickr and based on either their current GPS location or by a place of the user's choosing through the Google Places API.

## Coming Soon
    1. Integration with the Google Places API to allow the user to type in a location of their choice and see photos based on their submission.
    2. Pretty CSS, including mobile optimization
    3. Use of Math.Random to start the user on a randomly selected photo
    4. The option to browse through the photos in "slideshow mode"
    5. The option to browse through the photos in "gallery mode"
    6. The option to search for photos by keyword
    7. A better README.md
